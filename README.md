# stengography
This project introduces a comprehensive steganography platform capable of embedding and extracting hidden data within text, audio, image, and video files. By securely encoding sensitive information into multimedia formats, the system ensures robust data protection and confidentiality. Users can encode plaintext messages into images, audio, and videos or hide one image within another, providing versatile solutions for secure communication. The platform also supports efficient decoding to retrieve the concealed data. With a user-friendly interface and advanced steganographic techniques, this system 
addresses the growing demand for secure and covert data transmission across various digital mediums.
